# dotfiles

Dotfiles via GNU Stow.

To my future self:
Simply use the `stow` command inside the `.dotfiles` folder to create symlinks with the configuration you need.

Example

```sh
stow alacritty
```

## Alacritty

A standard configuration for Alacritty. Note that `fonts.toml` uses `JetBrains Mono`.

## Visual Studio Code (Code)

A general configuration for VS Code. Aims at the Catppuccin and Sweet Dracula colour theme with some modifications. This section is constantly changing according to needs.

## Color-Schemes

Some colour schemes for KDE Plasma. Mostly, these are custom colour schemes. Some feature slight changes like the Catppuccin schemes, and others are completely from scratch like Darkly.

## Corectrl

Gaming profiles: Automatically applies overlcock/undervolting and a custom cooling curve for the RX 5700 XT.

## DeaDBeef

A simple configuration of DeaDBeeF to get a complete interface (inspired by iTunes).

## Fish

General Fish configuration with some useful aliases. In full development because I haven't gone deep enough into Fish yet.

## Helix Editor

Alternative to Vim and Neovim written in Rust. I don't have enough time to configure Neovim or get interested in how it works and what plug-ins/extensions I need. Helix works OOTB.

## MangoHud

Some configurations to show metrics in video games with enough design to not be annoying. Also, I based the colour scheme on Dracula.

## Mozilla-Startpage

My home page. It does not use personal information or specific links, so anyone can use it.

## MPV

MPV configuration. Anime-shaders and fidelityfx-shaders are used in addition to thumbast, sponsorblock and ModernX for the interface.
Some plug-ins are focused on AMD GPUs. Although the configuration still works for me, I suspect I need to update it.
